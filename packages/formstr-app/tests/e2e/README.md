# E2E tests

A small, deliberately focused Playwright suite that exercises the core formstr
flows end to end. These are **health checks**, not UI specs.

## Tests

- **form-roundtrip** — create a form → publish → fill → submit (anonymous) →
  read the response back. The core spine.
- **sign-as-yourself** — submit a response as a logged-in user (signs up through
  the real login modal). The key guard for the signer migration.
- **required-field** — a required field blocks submission until answered.
- **sections** — a sectioned form renders the stepper, gates each step on
  validation, and navigates by clicking step titles (next validates and
  advances, back jumps freely, skipping ahead is blocked). Guards the fixed
  step-click behaviour.
- **all-field-types** — one of every field type is filled and verified to
  round-trip into the responses view (see notes below).

## Running

```bash
# from packages/formstr-app
yarn test:e2e        # headless
yarn test:e2e:ui     # Playwright UI mode
yarn test:e2e form-roundtrip   # a single file
```

Playwright boots two servers itself (via the `webServer` config; both are reused
if already running):

1. a **local in-memory nostr relay** (`tests/e2e/relay-server.cjs`) on port 7448, and
2. the dev server (`yarn start` on port 3000), started with
   `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_RELAYS=ws://localhost:7448` so the whole app reads/writes
   against the local relay only.

## Principles

- Interactions are driven the way a **user** would: accessible roles, visible
  text, placeholders, labels — never `data-testid`. A few icon-only controls the
  app ships without an accessible name (the "required" asterisk, the submit
  split-button caret) are reached by their semantic markup; adding `aria-label`s
  in the app would let us drop even those.
- Tests never touch `localStorage` or signer internals, so they stay valid after
  `LocalSigner` is replaced by `@formstr/signer`.

## Notes

- No live relays — fast (~3–15s per test) and deterministic, retries disabled so
  real flakiness surfaces. The relay is in-memory and wiped on restart.
- `getDefaultRelays()` (`src/nostr/common.ts`) honors the `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_RELAYS`
  env var; it's unset in production. `form-roundtrip` decodes the published form's
  `naddr` and asserts it points at the local relay, so a broken override fails
  loudly instead of silently using live relays.
- The `all-field-types` form is **seeded** as a signed event directly to the relay
  (a fixture — full control over labels/options/grids); only the fill is driven as
  a user. Fields with verbatim responses (text/number/email/choices/file/rating)
  are checked by value; the rest (date/time/grids/signature) are marked REQUIRED so
  a green run proves their fill captured a value. The Blossom upload is mocked via
  `page.route` so the file field works offline.
- Browsers are installed with `npx playwright install chromium`.
